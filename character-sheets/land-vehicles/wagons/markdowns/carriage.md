## Carriage
*Type: Vehicle (Land) Cost: 100 gp (uncovered); 400 gp (cabin); 600 gp (armored) Weight: 600-800 lbs*
:
A Carriage has a raised seat for driver and assistant. It has large wheels to overcome uneven terrain or muddy roads. Carriages can carry more weight than wagons, are faster, and have yokes for 2 or 4 horses. Stagecoaches are carriages with built in cabins that protect the passengers from weather and stray arrows.
:
**Cargo Capacity.** An animal pulling a carriage, wagons/images, chariot, sled, or Carriage can move weight up to five times its base carrying Capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carrying Capacity together. An Overloaded Vehicle has a movement speed of zero. While above Normal Capacity the Carriage moves at half speed, and can not take the "Dash" action.
:
**Draft Animals.** The Carriage has a yoke for 2-4 Draft Animals.
:
**Reins.** The Reins include the bit, bridle, and yokes for the pulling animal. When operated they allow the Carriage to make turns. Evasive maneuvers can be accomplished with successful Animal Handling checks defined by the DM. Using a Bonus Action one can make a successful DC 15 Animal Handling check for the Carriage to "Dash"

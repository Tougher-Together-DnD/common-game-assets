## Wagon

:
A wagon has detachable side benches and a front seat that can accommodate 7 passengers and one steward. Or the benches removed for cargo. Wagons have large wheels for traveling on uneven ground, mud, or even slight snow without getting stuck. Though they may have to move slower.
:
A cover of ribs and canvas can be purchased to cover the wagon to provide some shade or protection from precipitation.
:
**Cargo Capacity.** An animal pulling a carriage, wagons/images, chariot, sled, or Carriage can move weight up to five times its base carrying Capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carrying Capacity together. An Overloaded Vehicle has a movement speed of zero. While above Normal Capacity the Carriage moves at half speed, and can not take the "Dash" action.
:
**Draft Animals.** The Carriage has a yoke for 1 Draft Animals.
:
**Reins.** The Reins include the bit, bridle, and yokes for the pulling animal. When operated they allow the Carriage to make turns. Evasive maneuvers can be accomplished with successful Animal Handling checks defined by the DM. Using a Bonus Action one can make a successful DC 15 Animal Handling check for the Carriage to "Dash"

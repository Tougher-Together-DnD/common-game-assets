The humble [rowboat][Item Link] serves to ferry passengers back and forth from larger ships or to navigate lakes and rivers. Due to its simple, Versatile design, a rowboat has no decks or typical crew. Weighing 100 pounds, a rowboat is easy to transport and might be carried by larger ships.

## Features
***Ship Repair***. [Repairs](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Infernal%20War%20Machines%20Rules#h-Repairs) to a damaged ship can be made while the vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 hit point of damage requires 1 day and costs 20 gp for materials and labor.

***Oars***. 2 benches are built into the deck, each with a 10-foot-long oar. When the ship is rowed, crew members sit on these benches to work the oars. One spare oar is kept under the bench.

## Example Crew
No standard compliment. The rowboat is a service vessel and doesn't require much knowledge to operate. Nearly anyone can row the boat successfully in calm water.

## Rowboat
*Type: Vehicle (Water) Cost: 50 gp Weight: 100 lbs*
:
If you have proficiency with a certain kind of vehicle (land or water), you can add your proficiency bonus to any check you make to control that kind of vehicle in difficult circumstances.
:
Rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can’t be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores. A rowboat weighs 100 pounds, in case adventurers carry it over land.
:
**Ship Repair.** [Repairs](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Infernal%20War%20Machines%20Rules#h-Repairs) to a damaged ship can be made while the vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 hit point of damage requires 1 day and costs 20 gp for materials and labor.
:
**Oars.** 2 benches are built into the deck, each with a 10-foot-long oar. When the ship is rowed, crew members sit on these benches to work the oars. One spare oar is kept under the bench.
:
**Example Crew.** No standard compliment. The rowboat is a service vessel and doesn't require much knowledge to operate. Nearly anyone can row the boat successfully in calm water.
